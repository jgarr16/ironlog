# IronLog 🏋️

A lightweight, mobile-first workout tracking app for two people training together. Built as a single HTML file, hosted on GitHub Pages, with Firebase for data persistence and a pluggable AI coaching layer.

**Live app:** [jgarr16.github.io/ironlog](https://jgarr16.github.io/ironlog/)

---

## Features

- **5-day push/pull/legs program** — pre-loaded for John and Kyong with individual starting weights and rep targets
- **Progressive overload tracking** — automatically flags weight increases when you hit the top of your rep range across all sets
- **Exercise preview mode** — tap any exercise to view details (weights, reps, photos) without starting a workout
- **Stepper controls** — adjust weights (+/- 5 lbs) and reps (+/- 1) with tap-friendly buttons, no keyboard needed
- **Flexible workout navigation** — Previous/Next buttons to move between exercises, exit button to leave mid-workout
- **Machine photos** — upload photos of your gym equipment; they display during each exercise
- **AI Coach** — multi-turn chat with full program context and session history injected automatically
- **Vendor-agnostic LLM** — works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any local model (Ollama etc.)
- **Session history** — every workout logged to Firebase, never drifts or guesses
- **Mobile-first** — designed for iPhone use at the gym

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — single `index.html` |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages |
| Database | Firebase Realtime Database |
| File Storage | Firebase Storage (machine photos) |
| AI | Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / Custom API |

No build tools. No npm. No frameworks. Just one file.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork or clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgarr16/ironlog.git
```

### 2. Set up Firebase
1. Create a project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable **Realtime Database** and **Storage**
3. Grab your project credentials from Project Settings → General → Web App

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Push `index.html` to your repo
- Go to **Settings → Pages → Branch: main** → Save

### 4. Configure the app
Open the live URL, and on first load you'll see a setup screen. Enter:
- Firebase API Key, Project ID, Database URL, Storage Bucket
- Your LLM provider and API key (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, or custom)
- Your program start date

All credentials are stored in your browser's `localStorage` — nothing is hardcoded in the source.

## Firebase Security Rules

### Realtime Database
The app requires an index on the `t` field for session sorting. Add this to your rules:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "sessions": {
      ".indexOn": ["t"]
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ During initial setup, you may use time-based or open rules temporarily. Lock these down with `auth != null` before sharing the app with anyone.

### Storage
```
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /machines/{imageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Progression Rules

- **Upper body:** hit top of rep range all 3 sets → **+5 lbs** next session
- **Lower body:** hit top of rep range all 3 sets → **+10 lbs** next session
- **Timed holds:** hit max time all 3 sets → **+5 sec** next session
- Below minimum → maintain current weight

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Firebase Authentication (lock down security rules)
- [ ] Test mode (write to `/test/` path prefix, delete without affecting real data)
- [ ] Image compression before upload
- [ ] Firebase offline persistence for poor gym signal
- [ ] AI-driven program evolution at weeks 4–5 (new exercise suggestions)
- [ ] CSV/JSON export of session history

---

## Importing Historical Data

Sessions can be bulk-imported via Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Import JSON. See the data structure above for the required format.
